## Description  
In this course students will learn non-statistical aspects of elucidating from data its information content which leads to knowledge. Several differing visual techniques will be examined to gain this knowledge through exploratory use of visualizations as well as visualization techniques for presenting data to a variety of stakeholders. Exploratory techniques look to find patterns in the data. Finding patterns that underlie the system’s characteristics when the data sets are large or have many dimensions by reducing the dimensionality in intelligent ways is a complex task that often includes user direction. Presentation visualizations provide the viewer with useful information and knowledge since the visualizations are created with context in mind. This course will be completed completely online: assignments will be issued most weeks and due before the next class begins. One larger visualization project will be completed at the end of the course and will be displayed on a public website.
  
##Course objectives  
At the completion of this course, students should be able to:
* Understand the principles of data visualization
* Apply these principles in both interactive and status graphics
* Demonstrate familiarity with several modern data visualization tools and libraries
* Efficiently create visualizations for diagnostics and analysis
